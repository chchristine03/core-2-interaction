QUESTIONNAIRE

    <ol>
        <li class="title">Describe your previous experiences with coding. What classes have you already taken where you were exposed
            to HTML/CSS/JS? What parts of the class resonated with you? What parts were most confusing?</li>
            I have taken AP computer science course in high school that introduced me to javascript for a bit,
        last semester, I have taken "Digital Dev: Creative Machine Learning" elective that introduced me to Python, AI, ML, 
        and I also took the Core 1 Interaction class. However, besides the Interaction class, I never learned how to web design so it is still all very new to me.
        I found it interesting to be able to translate computer
        languages into a visual structure of a website that has an endless possibilities of incorporating interactive elements as well.
        However, the parts that were the most confusing were how to create a grid/box system that follows my initial design and resizing the visual elements.

        <li class="title">How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in
            this class to help reduce this anxiety?</li>
            I am very excited to learn coding as I believe design and technology is the future of creativity. I am not nervous to learn code,
            as I will put in my most effort to learn.

            <Br>               
        <li class="title">How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</li>
            I believe coding will open doors to emerging technologies and designing innovatively dealing with algorithms, problem-solving,
            and UI/UX.

        <li class="title">Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub.</li>
        I have for my Creative ML elective and Interaction 1 to write, share, read codes, and also to create a repository for my website to be shared to the public. 
            <Br>
            <Br> 
        <li class="title">Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this
            relationship. Bonus points for creative analogies.</li>
            HTML is like the human bones, it's the base structure that is necessary to create pages of the web. CSS is like the human skin, it's 
            covers on top of the bones. It's what makes every website have a unique style with different colors, typeface, how the content is displayed.
            Javascript is the human actions, it allows dynamic actions to be done with the elements on the web.
