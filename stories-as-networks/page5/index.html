        Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. 
    </div>
    <div class="title"> This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. 
    </div>
    <div class="title">That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand.
    </div>
    <div class="title">Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end. 
    </div>
    <div class="title">When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” 
    </div>
    <a href="https://chchristine03.github.io/core-2-interaction/stories-as-networks/page6/index.html" class="button">where???</a>
    <div class="title end">he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated.
